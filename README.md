# reveal - a command-line instance-of container/vm/physical-system/service manager

Reveal, a Scala-native re-implementation of Session, implementing new ideas
related to dynamic namespacing. Yes, this needs more explanation.

For now a quick note:

    sbt run

Doing the above creates a native binary under `target/scala-*/reveal-out`.
